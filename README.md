# Dynamic_Pricing_Simulator
## Project Description
The **Dynamic Pricing Simulator** project is aimed at developing a Java Swing application that allows the pricing team within the marketing department to efficiently manage and adjust **car pricing** based on real-time sales data. By simulating the impact of various target price adjustments on profitability, the application empowers the pricing team to make data-driven decisions, maximize profit margins, and enhance overall company performance.

The project focuses on implementing a **range pricing model** for cars and adheres strictly to the reference architecture technique of profiles and workspaces. This ensures consistent application design and a structured approach to handling car data and pricing simulations.

## Key Features
* **Interactive Car Price Management:**
Engage with car pricing through an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows the pricing team to analyze and adjust target prices for different car models in real-time.
* **Dynamic Car Price Adjustment:**
Automatically suggest increasing or decreasing target prices for cars based on actual sales performance, ensuring timely and data-driven pricing decisions for various models.
* **Simulation of Pricing Scenarios:**
Run simulations to observe how changes in target car prices affect overall sales revenue and profitability, enabling the team to experiment with different pricing strategies across multiple car models.
* **Profit Optimization:**
Continuously refine and test pricing strategies through repeated simulations to maximize the companyâ€™s profit margins for car sales effectively.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:**
Generate detailed performance reports for each car model, including target prices before and after adjustment, revenue comparison, and sales frequency analysis for better decision-making.
* **Admin Dashboard:**
Administrators can manage car suppliers, car models, and sales records, ensuring that the system remains accurate and up-to-date.
